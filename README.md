# MNIST-Deep-Neural-Network
# Simple Feedforward Neural Network from Scratch (MNIST)

This project implements a **fully connected neural network** from scratch (using only `NumPy`) to classify handwritten digits from the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). The network includes:

- Forward propagation
- Manual backpropagation with stochastic gradient descent
- Training and prediction functions
- Visualization of errors and predictions

No machine learning frameworks are used beyond `TensorFlow/Keras` to download the dataset.
